# Encryptor-Decryptor

To use Encryptor:
  Type message to be encrypted into the input, "Encrypt: ".
  The output will contain the message followed be the key to decrypt the message, seperated by a "|".
  For example the input "Encryption" would be output as "uZI-KxNFwF|0LFQlhtwhr".
  Bear in mind the key is random, so the output will always be different.

To use Decryptor:
  Type the encrypted message into the input, "Decrypt: ".
  Type the key into the input, "Key: ".
  The decrypted message will be outputted.
  For example, from the aformentioned use of Encryptor, inputting "uZI-KxNFwF" first and "0LFQlhtwhr" second will output "Encryption".

Warnings:
  You can only use the following characters, else the results are untested but will not work - most likely crashing.
